**We're looking for new contributors!**
[Kevin](https://kvns.website/) and I are both grad students now and don't have much time to work on this. That said if you come along and write a section or even open a PR for some wording changes, I'll be happy to look it over and most likely merge it. See below for more info.

# Rudin: Translated

Walter Rudin's [_Principles of Mathematical
Analysis_](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/principles-mathematical-analysis-rudin/M007054235X.html)
is a tried and true textbook for learning analysis, but as anyone has ever read
it can say, it is very terse. This leaves many readers struggling through
clever arguments and stumbling through manipulations. With this project we aim
to take Rudin's great organization of the subjects material, but present it in
a way that more can appreciate. With more intuitive explanations, graphics, and
anything else we can that aids in learning a notoriously hard subject like
analysis.
